# NOTHING IMPLEMENTED YET FOR N1MM+! COME BACK IN A FEW MONTHS!
This is currently just the stock BarRaider template for Stream Deck plug-ins.  I have yet to implement the N1MM+ UDP listener, or any parsing/sending of events, or anything at all.

I plan to implement an Elgato Stream Deck plug-in that automatically retrieves the N1MM+ Bandmap macro buttons, presents them on the Stream Deck, and sends events directly to the N1MM+ window regardless of what application is in use.  I would like to represent current toggle state as well.  I'll need to get new features from N1MM+ team to realize this effort, but in the meantime I'll work on just parsing the N1MM+ Bandmap button export file format to create the button layouts.

N1MM+ Bandmap button documentation and sample usage:

## Downloadable Resources
* [StreamDeck-Tools Template](https://github.com/BarRaider/streamdeck-tools/raw/master/utils/StreamDeck-Tools%20Template.vsix) for Visual Studio (2019/2022) - Automatically creates a project with all the files needed to compile a plugin. This is the best way to start a new plugin!
* [Install.bat](https://github.com/BarRaider/streamdeck-tools/blob/master/utils/install.bat) - Script that quickly uninstalls and reinstalls your plugin on the streamdeck (edit the batch file for more details). Put the install.bat file in your BIN folder (same folder that has Debug/Release sub-folders)
* [EasyPI](https://github.com/BarRaider/streamdeck-easypi) - Additional library used to easily pass information from the PI (Property Inspector) to your plugin.
